# Work-Day-Scheduler-H5
## Description

- Homework 5 is to create a day scheduler that will allow saving items into the local storage.

- We had to manipulate the html and create a .js file to make the day scheduler.

## Usage

* GIVEN using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN the planner is opened
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN scrolled down
* THEN timeblocks for standard business hours are presented
* WHEN viewing the timeblocks for that day
* THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN clicked into a timeblock
* THEN an event can be entered
* WHEN clicked the save button for that timeblock
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN the page is refreshed
* THEN the saved events persist
